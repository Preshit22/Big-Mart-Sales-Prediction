### Introduction

Welcome to the Big Mart Sales Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting sales for Big Mart, a prominent retail chain. The objective of this project is to develop an accurate machine learning model that can forecast sales for different products in various stores.

### Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data collection: Gather sales data, along with relevant attributes such as product information and store details.

2. Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for training the machine learning model.

3. Feature engineering: Extract meaningful features and transform the data for model training.

4. Model selection: Choose the most suitable regression model to predict sales based on the dataset.

5. Model training: Train the selected model on the prepared dataset.

6. Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tune if necessary.

7. Sales prediction: Use the trained model to predict sales for new data.

### Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Preshit22/Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Source

The dataset used for this project can be found at [provide_data_source_link_here]. Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate data directory before running the code.

### Data Preprocessing

Before training the machine learning model, the raw data needs to be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. The preprocessing steps are detailed in the [data_preprocessing.ipynb](notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.

### Model Training

The model training process is implemented in the [model_training.ipynb](notebooks/model_training.ipynb) Jupyter notebook. This includes selecting the model, hyperparameter tuning, and fitting the model to the prepared data.

### Model Evaluation

The [model_evaluation.ipynb](notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb) notebook contains the evaluation metrics and performance analysis of the trained model. This helps to understand how well the model performs on unseen data.

### Usage

To predict sales for new data using the trained model, follow the instructions in the [usage.ipynb](notebooks/usage.ipynb) notebook.

### Contributing
